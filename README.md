# MortgageCalculator

This vanilla js mortgage calculator calculates your monthly payment based on your loan amount, principal, interest, years, and interest rate. 

It. works. perfectly. (I compared the numbers to my mortgage payment and we have a match!) :) 

Just clone and open the html page in your browser.
